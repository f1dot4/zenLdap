zenLdap Introduction
====================
This is a Zenphoto-plugin that allows an LDAP-authentication against Microsoft Active Directory and OpenLDAP.
The login-function checks first if there is a local-db user available (for the given credentials), if not, it will try to authenticate against the given LDAP-directory

Setup
=====
Install the php-ldap extension, if you have apt:

 "apt-get install php5-ldap"
 
The plugin php script ldap_logon.php must be placed in "<zenphoto-directory>/plugins/ldap_logon.php".
In addition the lib-auth.php must be replaced - to do this create a folder named "alt" in the plugins directory

 "mkdir <zenphoto-directory>/alt/plugins/alt/"
 
and place the alternative lib-auth.php in the alt-folder.

How it works
============
Basically you have to create and configure zenphoto-groups (through the zenplugin user_groups).
The zen-groups have to exist in the LDAP-Directory too (same group-name only).
During the login, the plugin receives the groups of the user. If there is a match between LDAP-group and Zenphoto-group, the zenphoto-group rights will be merged into the LDAP-user.
If there is no match, a default-template can be defined on the plugin-option page, than those rights will be used for the user.

Troubleshooting
===============
* Use the local-DB admin user to display the "debug.log" on the admin-page. It is most likely that there are some troubles regarding the given LDAP data.
* When creating a new OpenLDAP-user, you will have to use the user first somewhere else before you can use it as the Zenphoto-LDAP login (e.g. login into phpLDAPadmin)
* Use the tool "ldapsearch" to check your configured LDAP-properties on the plugin-option-page.
* "ldapsearch -h HOSTNAME -b 'dc=DOMAIN' -D 'cn=reader,dc=DOMAIN' -W -x" this will promt for the reader-password and then prints out lots of LDAP-stuff. The content of the -D option: cn=reader,dc=DOMAIN is right one for the "LDAP Reader DN"-textbox on the plugin-option-page
